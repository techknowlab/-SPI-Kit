### Improvements to be done in this version:
1 - moisture sensor mount to be improved and make it more strengthful
2- 10 mm pillow below thw moisture sensor
3- hole in the LED channel of the pot
4- TechKnowLab embossing font is too small - increase font or remove it.
5- bolt hole in the uController box.
6- DHT11 Sensor mount has to be improved
